# es6-library-boilerplate

Author libraries in ES6 for Node and the browser.

### Features

- Author in ES6
- Export ES5 / UMD
- Mocha/Chai/Sinon testing stack
- Unit tests that work in Node and the browser

### Usage

This library is built with Gulp. There are three main Gulp
tasks for you to use.

- `gulp` - Lint the library and tests, then run the unit tests
- `gulp build` - Lint then build the library
- `gulp test:browser` - Build the library for use with the browser spec runner.
  Changes to the source will cause the runner to automatically refresh.

### FAQ

Configuring this library requires making changes in several places. A guide
to do this will be coming soon!
